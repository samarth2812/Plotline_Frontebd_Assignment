## In-App Nudges Frontend App
 ## Problem Statement
In-app nudges provide non-intrusive guides for various features of a mobile app. Setting up tooltips will help draw attention to a given element on the screen. The purpose of this project is to build a frontend app that allows users to create tooltips with dynamic positioning, style, and text. The app will also include a live preview of the tooltip being rendered.

## Instructions
Build a frontend app using React.js / Next.js to create and preview tooltips. The app should allow users to set the target element, position (top/right/bottom/left), style, text, and optionally include an image inside the tooltip. The tooltip component should be built and positioned without the use of any additional libraries.

 ## Features
## Must-Haves
Tooltip Creation: Users should be able to create tooltips by specifying the target element, position (top/right/bottom/left), style, and text.

Real-Time Preview: The app should provide a real-time preview of a mobile screen with button elements. These buttons will act as the target elements for the tooltip to be rendered.

Custom Styling: Users should be able to customize the style of the tooltip, including background color, text color, font size, border, etc.

Persistent Data: The data used to build the tooltip should be persistent, allowing users to create, modify, and save tooltips for future reference.

Good-to-Have
Image Support: Ability to include an image inside the tooltip. Users should be able to upload an image and style it within the tooltip.
Design
The design for the app is available in the provided Figma file.
